# Live Eternal

Live Eternal is a generative Black Metal piece for the Webbrowser. It breaks down the quintessential elements of Black Metal into algorithms that generate new riffs every time one listens to the piece. It further pushes the boundaries of what generative music in the web can be and how we listen to generative music in general.

Inspired by the more recent efforts of the Black Metal avant-garde to push dehumanization and de-individualization to new limits, combined with the concepts of anonymity an the negation of self-staging - that have been a part of the genre since its birth - I strive to push the boundaries even further, seeing a generative approach as one very viable, if not logical continuation. I feel that this approach is a meaningful way of leveraging technology to add musical value to the genre and opens up a new conceptual dimension of Black Metal.
